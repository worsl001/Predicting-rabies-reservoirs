# Carnivore and Bat Rabies Reservoirs

### Objective
Predict unknown carnivore and bat rabies reservoirs (Worsley-Tonks KEL, Escobar LE, Biek R, Castaneda M, Craft ME, Streicker DG, White LA, Fountain-Jones NM. Using host traits to predict reservoir host species of rabies virus)


### Items included in repository
* two excel and two csv files: two excel files that include known rabies reservoir classification based on the literature (one for carnivores and one for bats); and two csv files that include rabies reservoir classification and PanTHERIA traits (one for carnivores and one for bats)
* a literature work flow
* R script to run GBM and shapley value
* functions to performed downsampling and assess model performance (developed by Fountain-Jones et al. 2019)
